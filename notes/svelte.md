SVELTE
Svelte is a compiler for creating reactive web apps and interfaces.
What is a compiler?
A compiler is a software that translates a program written in a high level language to a low level language.
so can we say beyond it being a library for making Frontend Applications, svelte is like babel since babel is a trans compiler?
question:
How is JSX processed before babel transpiles it?
why is svelte comparatively faster(smaller size)? what are the key differences between Vue, React and Svelte beyond size and how does it translate to better Frontend Development?
