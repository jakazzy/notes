SVELTE
Svelte is a compiler for creating reactive web apps and interfaces.
What is a compiler?
A compiler is a software that translates a program written in a high level language to a low level language.
so can we say beyond it being a library for making Frontend Applications, svelte is like babel since babel is a trans compiler?
question:
How is JSX processed before babel transpiles it?
why is svelte comparatively faster(smaller size)? what are the key differences between Vue, React and Svelte beyond size and how does it translate to better Frontend Development?

Svelte is a compiler for creating reactive webapps and interfaces
a compiler is a software that translates a program written in a high level language to a low level language.
If svelte is a compiler because it takes a high level language and converts it to a low level language(or into a language the browser can understand)
The can we make the association that svelte is to babel? since babel is a trans compiler?
How does the browser identify or inteprete JSX?(i mean the steps before babel transpiles it)

Main difference between svelte, Vue and Reactjs
Svelte is a compiler not a framework
svelte compiles your code at buildtime into a single vanilla javascript bundle
No extra scripts or libraries are shipped into production
Results in faster running websites

How are languages processed?
High level language

Differences between a compiler and an intepreter
The compiler scans the code, processes it and translates all the source code into machine code. Whereas an interpreter translates the program one statement at a time.
